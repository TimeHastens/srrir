# Hello and Welcome!

Srrir is a tool that can be used to count the number of Antivirus detections of malware samples.

Sometimes we are not able to distinguish if the Antivirus counts the "Objects" or just the "File Itself", or if the Antivirus has deleted, fixed or missed the malware sample. So Srrir was created to solve this problem!

# How to use Srrir?

Below are the instructions for use. 

The using instructions when you type "-h" or "-help" that the program shows are the same as these.

```
-h or -help: As the name implies, show the help for you.
-s: Follow the instructions and start your amazing journey.
-ver: Show the current program version.
```

# How does Srrir perform?

Seems to be not bad. Srrir uses Threadpool to improve the performance of IO and Sha256 calculations.

# The source code sucks

Sorry, I am a newbie in Rust. The program itself is very easy to simple. If you have any ideas or better ways to improve the program, please feel free to post Issues. A Pull Request is also very nice!

There are many problems in the source code. I will fix them in the near future. I will not stop updating until I think I have made it almost do what it should do and do it well.
